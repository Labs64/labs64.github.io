NetLicensing Validate Builder helps you to create the validation method call to retrieve the result of customer licenses validation.

Use *Labs64 NetLicensing RESTful API Test Center* - [LicenseeService.validate()](https://netlicensing.io/NetLicensing-API/#!/Licensee/validateLicensee)

#### Did you know?

NetLicensing API services cover all licensing aspects, allowing to fully automate your licensing flow, and/or integrate NetLicensing into your business processes: ERP, CRM or Webshop.
However, if you only need basic integration into your product, there are two [essential NetLicensing RESTful API functions](https://netlicensing.io/wiki/restful-api#essentials): *Validate* and *Create Shop Token*.
